# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was created to help students navigate through their prework content in a more efficient manner, providing them with structure through a webpage. 

This reason this project was built was two-fold, the first as a learning curve for myself & the second as a tool to be used for learning by other students.

It solves the problem of not knowing where to start, which I find a lot of students face specifically when entering a new field. 

I learnt the fundamentals / basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, how to use Git, and a wide range of ways to learn.
